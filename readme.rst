*Animators, Developers, Filmmakers, & Artists. This Belongs to You.*

Home of the Kraken -- The free and open source 3D animation platform redefining
animation composition, collaborative workflows, simulation engines, skeletal
rigging systems, and look development from storyboard to final render. Built on
the underlying software architecture provided by Pixar, and extended to meet the
ever-growing needs of both artists and production pipelines. It is with this strong
core foundation, that we may begin to solve the most challenging issues the world
of modern graphics demands, and push the framework for composition & design into
the future.

File Format
============
The one and only -- **Universal** file format. The first of it's kind,
that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment
arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed from many elemental assets.
