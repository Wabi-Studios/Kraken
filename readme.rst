*A pixel-crushing, render-ripping, GPU incinerating machine.*

Home of the Kraken -- redefining animation composition, collaborative
workflows, simulation engines, skeletal rigging systems, and look development
from storyboard to final render. Built on the underlying software architecture
provided by Pixar, and extended to meet the ever-growing needs of both artists
and production pipelines. It is with this strong core foundation, that we may
begin to solve the most challenging issues the world of modern graphics demands,
and push the framework for composition & design into the future.

File Format
============
The one and only -- **Universal** file format. The first of it's kind,
that addresses the need to robustly and scalably interchange and augment
arbitrary 3D scenes that may be composed from many elemental assets.

Credits
=======
For the -- wow this looks like the blender build & overall directory structure! Blender's Open Source code taught me how to read/write/build C applications. And likewise, I began to fall in love with the overall design of things a bit. It was the months I spent tinkering around in a Blender build that just about taught me everything I know.

And I heavily thank you for everything.

 ‚ù§ Thank you Blender Foundation
xx Furby.
