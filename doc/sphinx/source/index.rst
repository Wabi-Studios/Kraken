Introduction
------------

Developer reference and home of the COVAH project -- redefining animation
composition, collaborative workflows, simulation engines, skeletal rigging
systems, and look development from storyboard to final render. Built on
the underlying software architecture provided by Pixar, and extended to
meet the ever-growing needs of both artists and production pipelines. It
is with this strong core foundation, that we may begin to solve the most
challenging issues the world of modern graphics demands, and push the
framework for composition & design into the future.


.. note::
   This is the developer reference as it pertains to the C++ codebase of
   COVAH. It is subject to change frequently, as different iterations are
   necessary to find to correct approach. Additionally, as of now there is
   no Python API, as more planning and guidance is necessary before it can
   recieve active development contributions.
