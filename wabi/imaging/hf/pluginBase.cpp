// WORKAROUND: As this class is a pure interface class, it does not need a
// vtable.  However, it is possible that some users will use rtti.
// This will cause a problem for some of our compilers:
//
// In particular clang will throw a warning: -wweak-vtables
// For gcc, there is an issue were the rtti typeid's are different.
//
// As destruction of the class is not on the performance path,
// the body of the deleter is provided here, so a vtable is created
// in this compilation unit.
