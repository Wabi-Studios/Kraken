// Example: FastFixedDtoa(0.001, 5, ...) is allowed to return buffer = "1", and
// decimal_point = -2.
// Halfway cases are rounded towards +/-Infinity (away from 0). The call
// FastFixedDtoa(0.15, 2, ...) thus returns buffer = "2", decimal_point = 0.
// The returned buffer may contain digits that would be truncated from the
// shortest representation of the input.
//
// This method only works for some parameters. If it can't handle the input it
// returns false. The output is null-terminated when the function succeeds.
